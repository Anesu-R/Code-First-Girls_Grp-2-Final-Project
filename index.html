            <p>Welcome to Deep Water Sea Creatures, a space for showcasing the magnificant world that exists underwater. Here, you will also find information on the impact that climate change is having on sea life as part of our campaign to educate individuals, organisations and governments on endangered species.</p>

                <h3>African Penguins</h3>
                <p>African penguins are currently regarded as vulnerable to extinction. Oil spills are a major threat to their survival. In earlier times the killing of penguins and the collection of their eggs for food, had devastating effects on the population. For example, in the early 1930s some 13-million eggs were collected off Dassen Island alone!</p>
                <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
                <p>These streamlined extant penguins primarily feed on fish and squid. Over their lifetime, they can grow up to 60–70 cm (24–28 in) tall and weigh between 2.2–3.5 kg (4.9–7.7 lb). In the wild, African Penguins have a lifespan of 10-15+ years, and up to 20 years in human care.</p>

                <h3>Hector’s and Maui’s Dolphins</h3>
                <p>Hector’s and Maui’s dolphins only live in New Zealand’s shallow coastal waters. Living close to shore is a problem for the dolphins. Bycatch—becoming tangled in recreational and commercial gill and trawl nets—is the biggest threat they face.  Gillnets, for example, are made of a fine mesh that dolphins are unable to detect underwater and they accidentally swim into them and become caught. Other threats include being struck by boats, pollution in their habitat, coastal development and seabed mining.</p>
